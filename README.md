# Swagger
Swagger (now known as OpenAPI Specification) is an open-source framework for creating, documenting, and consuming APIs. It standardizes how APIs are described, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with APIs. Swagger tools, like Swagger UI and Swagger Editor, simplify the process of API testing and documentation.
