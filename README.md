## What is Swagger (OpenAPI)?

Swagger (now known as OpenAPI Specification) is an open-source framework for creating, documenting, and consuming APIs. It standardizes how APIs are described, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with APIs. Swagger tools, like Swagger UI and Swagger Editor, simplify the process of API testing and documentation.

---

## Key Features

1. **API Documentation**:  
   - Automatically generates interactive API documentation.
2. **API Testing**:  
   - Allows developers to test API endpoints directly from the documentation.
3. **Standardized Specification**:  
   - Uses OpenAPI Specification (OAS) to describe APIs consistently.
4. **Swagger UI**:  
   - Provides a user-friendly interface to explore and interact with APIs.
5. **Swagger Editor**:  
   - Offers an online tool to write and edit OpenAPI specifications.
6. **Code Generation**:  
   - Generates client libraries, server stubs, and API documentation in various languages.
7. **Integration with Tools**:  
   - Works with API gateways, CI/CD pipelines, and other development tools.

## How Swagger Works

1. **API Specification**:  
   - Define the API structure using OpenAPI Specification (JSON or YAML format).
2. **Swagger Tools**:  
   - Use Swagger Editor to create or modify the API specification.
   - Use Swagger UI to generate interactive API documentation.
3. **Integration**:  
   - Integrate Swagger tools into development workflows, such as CI/CD pipelines, for testing and validation.
4. **Testing**:  
   - Test API endpoints directly through Swagger UI or third-party tools.
